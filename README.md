# Credit-Card-Anamoly-Detection


Hi All,

This small project is to detect the anamoly in credit cards transactions using machine learning

We will need python, some machine learning libraries like matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn , numpy , pandas , 


I will use jupyter notebook for the same but you can use any IDE you are confortable with, 

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from Kaggle -
The link to the dataset is - 


We are going to use a local outlier factor to calculate anomaly score
An isolation forest algorithm
These two algorithm will comb through the dataset of almost around 280,000 transactions and predict which ones are fraudalent
